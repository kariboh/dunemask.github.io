                    <img src="images/vector/Interface.jpg" alt = "Error 404 Image Unavailable :(" scr = "images/Hobbit.jpg"/>
                    <h2>Interface</h2>
                    <p>For my interface, I wanted to create my own type of house. So I decided to put it in space with multiple suns. Using some blurring I caused the odd radiance that you see.</p>
                    <p></p>
          </li>
                <li>
                    <img src = "images/vector/Drawing.jpg" alt = "Error 404 Image Unavailable :("/> 
                  <h2>Drawing Tools</h2>
                    <p>I chose to put a litle bit of flare on the banana with just a little bit of gradient and also gave the sun a gradient.</p>
                    <p></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <img src = "images/vector/Type.jpg" alt = "Error 404 Image Unavailable :("/>
                    <h2>Text</h2>
                     <p>For my type assignment I wanted to do words that applied to me. I saw my friend create a weird symbol using his initials, so I did the same with mine on my second drwaing board.</p>
                     <p></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <img src = "images/vector/Batman.jpg" alt = "Error 404 Image Unavailable :("/>
                    <h2>Batman</h2>
                    <p>My Batman, is when I chose to switch things up a bit. I wanted to do more of a firey look because fire is one of the things that I think describes me. I chose a lava texture that I found and think it works very good.</p>
                    <p></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <img src = "images/vector/Poster.png" alt = "Error 404 Image Unavailable :("/> 
                    <h2>Poster</h2>
                    <p>I wanted to put a theme to the alice in wonderland poster, and chose the end of the world. I have had lots of hard times in my life but I put that quote up at the top that i always say to myself. Recently I lost all my data on my computer and it was very devastating to me. Through some scavenging I have been, over time, able to scavange all of it and now it is finally restored.</p>
