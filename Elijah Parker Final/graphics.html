                    <h2>Basics</h2>
                    <p>For my basics I wanted to do a super banana might you say. So I put a cape on a banana in the sky.</p>
                    <p></p>
          </li>

                  <h2>Layers</h2>
                    <p>I really wanted to make something out of this world, so I chose to do color burn in a few places. I love the purple and black flowers because of the power they give to this. </p>
                    <p></p>
                </li>

                    <h2>Selection</h2>
                    <p>For this one I wanted to do my pet gerbil, so I used a picture of him and by using Selection Tools, I turned him to some more solid colors.</p>
                    <p></p>
                </li>

                    <h2>Masking</h2>
                    <p>WHen I saw one of my friends was doing something space related, I decided that I just had to do something space related as well. So I put a red tardis, a pulsar, and a space cow on a beach on mars.</p>
                    <p></p>
                </li>

                    <img src = "images/raster/PhotoCorrection.png" alt = "Error 404 Image Unavailable :("/> 
                    <h2>Photo Correction</h2>
                    <p>I really thought that the picture looked dark, so I brightedned things up and took care of a few of the problems I thought were really bad.</p>
                </li>

                	<img src="images/raster/Text_Filters.jpg" alt="Error 404 Image Unavailable :(">
				  <h2>Text & Filters</h2>
					<p>I love fire, I think it is so cool! So I decided to do more of a dark themed fire, and it turned out great!</p>
                    <p></p>

                    <h2>Poster</h2>
                    <p>For My poster I wanted to do something special, something that appealed to me. I chose this cover of empire becausae it is first of all the hobbit, and secondly it has one of the most epic wizards of all time!!!</p>
